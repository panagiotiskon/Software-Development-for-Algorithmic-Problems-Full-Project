## Getting Started:

This project was implemented for the course Developing Software for Algorithmic Problems (K23), during the winter semester 2022-2023 CS NKUA. 

The completion of the project came through three main phases. 

Initially, the Incremental and Convex Hull algorithms were implemented using a given set of points. Next in the Second phase to improve the effectiveness of 
the previously developed algorithms we implemented Local Search and Simulated Annealing(Locally - Globally). Lastly, in the Third and final part,
a preprocessing stage was created where different parameters of the algorithms were already chosen based on the size of the set and the time required for each algorithm to run. 
In addition, the program runs all different algorithm combinations and prints the results in the PROJECT_output.txt for comparison.
